                    Some have spots. Some have stripes. And some have a little of both. In Cat Forest, you'll get to visit a wide variety of cat carnivores--from snow leopards and jaguars to tigers and bobcats. Cat Forest is an enjoyable maze of forest-like trails and several buildings with glass enclosures for year-round observation.

                    The elephant family in our care is special to us and the world.
                    Asian elephants can grow up to 11,000 pounds and stand about 10 feet tall, although females elephants generally grow to about 8 ½ feet tall and weigh less than their male counterparts. </p>

                <!-- (ORIGINAL TEXT) The elephant family in our care is special to us and the world. The family plays an essential role in the survival of the elephant species in Africa and Asia because number of Asian elephants in the wild has diminished to an estimated 30,000 worldwide. Asian elephants can live up to 60 years in the wild, but most do not live that long due to dangers in their environment such as poaching and habitat destruction. The Asian elephant is on the Endangered Species List and is in real threat of becoming extinct if conservation efforts are not made to preserve the species.
                        Asian elephants can grow up to 11,000 pounds and stand about 10 feet tall, although females elephants generally grow to about 8 ½ feet tall and weigh less than their male counterparts. While their size may be distinguishing, their notorious grey color is not—this skin coloration allows them to blend in to their forest environment. Their trunks provide an important adaptation as they allow the elephants to reach objects close to the ground, eat, drink, blow dirt for skin protection, greet other elephants, fight and much more. -->
