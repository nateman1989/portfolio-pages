    <h1> Exhibits</h1>
    <br>
    <h2> BEARS</h2>
    <p>Currently, the Zoo has two species of bears--grizzly bears and black bears. Their exhibits are located in the Oklahoma Trails area of the Zoo. Guests always enjoy visiting grizzly Zoo-favorites, Will and Wiley, who can be seen in the Cross Timbers section of Oklahoma Trails! </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>CAT FOREST </h2>
    <p> Some have spots. Some have stripes. And some have a little of both. In Cat Forest, you'll get to visit a wide variety of cat carnivores--from snow leopards and jaguars to tigers and bobcats. Cat Forest is an enjoyable maze of forest-like trails and several buildings with glass enclosures for year-round observation.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>CHILDREN'S ZOO </h2>
    <p> The Children's Zoo opened on March 12, 2010, as a 2.5 acre area within the Oklahoma City Zoo dedicated to the enrichment and education of children. Children can explore, touch and immerse themselves in a natural outdoor environment that will stimulate their imagination, encourage exploration and give them a greater appreciation for nature.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>ELEPHANTS </h2>
    <p> The elephant family in our care is special to us and the world. The family plays an essential role in the survival of the elephant species in Africa and Asia because number of Asian elephants in the wild has diminished to an estimated 30,000 worldwide. Asian elephants can live up to 60 years in the wild, but most do not live that long due to dangers in their environment such as poaching and habitat destruction. The Asian elephant is on the Endangered Species List and is in real threat of becoming extinct if conservation efforts are not made to preserve the species.
        <br><br>
        Asian elephants can grow up to 11,000 pounds and stand about 10 feet tall, although females elephants generally grow to about 8 ½ feet tall and weigh less than their male counterparts. While their size may be distinguishing, their notorious grey color is not—this skin coloration allows them to blend in to their forest environment. Their trunks provide an important adaptation as they allow the elephants to reach objects close to the ground, eat, drink, blow dirt for skin protection, greet other elephants, fight and much more.

    <br>
    <h2> HERPETARIUM</h2>
    <p>With more than 65 habitats, you will find slithering, scaly, shiny and sleek animals to fascinate you and enhance your learning experience at the Herpetarium. Built in 1928, the historic building has recently undergone renovations to highlight a vibrant diversity of reptiles and amphibians from around the world.
        <br> <br>
        You can see a variety of reptiles, from a giant reticulated python to the impressive king cobra. You’ll be amazed at our anaconda and venomous Mexican beaded lizards. You can learn how the shingleback skink got its name or where a scheltopusik comes from. And you won't want to miss Rattlesnake Wall which showcases several species of rattlesnakes from around the world.
        <br><br>
        If you prefer amphibians, take a look at the critically endangered Kaiser spotted newts, which in the wild are limited to one mountain range in Iran. Don’t forget our awesome axolotls that, in the wild, are only found one place on earth--a lake beneath Mexico City.
        <br><br>
        The Reptile and Amphibian staff members who care for these animals have received many awards for first-time breeding and successfully propagating more than 100 different species of reptiles and amphibians in captivity. They also share their interest in these animals beyond the walls of the Herpetarium by participating in conservation projects in Oklahoma and other countries around the world.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>HOOFED ANIMALS </h2>
    <p>Who knew that hoofed animals in the Zoo's Savannah exhibit could cause such a stir? This mixture of unique animals can stretch to the sky or dig up the ground, and many are endangered. The Zoo's collection includes the critically endangered Grevy's zebra; Grant's Zebra; a herd of majestic giraffes; ostriches; Grant's gazelle; Asian deer species, including the Pere David, which is extinct in the wild; and the newly discovered okapi, located in only one forest in the world--the Ituri in the Congo. The exhibit also includes some African carnivore, such as the wild dog, cheetah and bat-eared fox.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>ISLAND LIFE </h2>
    <p>Showcasing animals from around the world that live on islands, your tour through the Island Life exhibit is an island hopping experience. From the Caribbean to Madagascar to the Philippines, many of the unique and often endemic (only found there) species from these islands can be seen.
        <br> <br>
        Watch as giant Galapagos tortoises awkwardly roam around while beautiful Caribbean flamingos move in graceful motion together. You can see the Abaco Island boa constrictor and the robust San Esteban Island chuckwalla lizard in habitats that mimic their natural island existence. You can also spy Komodo dragons and the Frog Wall that showcases frogs and toads.
        <br> <br>
        During your visit you can learn about the fragile ecosystems that exist on islands and the natural balance that occurs every day. You can answer fascinating questions suchas "Why are flamingos pink?", " How are islands formed?" and "How long does it take for a Galapagos tortoise to reach adulthood." Come, experience the wonders of island lifeforms from around the world and their unique ecosystems.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2> LION OVERLOOK</h2>
    <p>There is a new king in town! African lion, Hubert, joined the Zoo in late 2012. He was born at the Milwaukee County Zoo in July 2011 and came to the Zoo as part of the Species Survival Plan supported by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
        <br> <br>
        Since then, Hubert has been acclimating to his new habitat and slowly meeting female lions, Tia and Bridget. Tia and Bridget have not had a male lion companion since the death of Zoo-favorite, Aslan, in March 2012.
        <br> <br>
        Like Aslan before, Hubert joined the pride as a healthy, young and handsome cat. He will not have a full mane for awhile but will be an impressive, big cat when he is full grown.
        <br> <br>
        Although he was initially shy, Hubert is getting more comfortable with his surroundings and has already been seen perched on top of the hill in Lion Overlook surveying his new “kingdom.” Because introductions can take awhile, guests may see either the females or Hubert. As they spend more time bonding, guests may see the entire pride relaxing and playing together.
    </p>
    <h2>
        MARINE MAMMALS
    </h2>
    <p>By far one of the Zoo's most popular attractions, the marine mammal showcase at the Noble Aquatic Center is a spectacular showcase of California Sea Lions and Harbor Seals.

        It's an experience where understanding and education go hand-in-hand with entertainment and family fun.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> OKLAHOMA TRAILS ADVENTURE</h2>
    <p>Explore eight acres of the state's natural beauty as you experience Oklahoma Trails. This $10.3 million naturalistic habitat showcases more than 100 different species of animals native to Oklahoma and more than 800 individual animals, while allowing guests to enjoy the 11 distinct life zones unique to Oklahoma!
        <br> <br>
        Travel the suspended boardwalk and explore the grassy terrain of Black Mesa, the rolling hills of the Ozark Highlands, and feel the mist from the Zoo's 25-foot. replica of Turner Falls located at Big Rivers! </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2> POWERFUL PACHYDERM</h2>
    <p> Located west of the Zoo's main entrance, the historical Pachyderm Building, built in 1963, houses pachyderm and bird species from around the world. Guests will see the Zoo's collection of endangered Indian rhinos and critically endangered Black rhinos, watch a pygmy hippo swim in his pond and listen to a variety of wild birds. Guests can also explore the unique outdoor yards with water features, mud wallows and grassland. These yards enable Zoo keepers to shift the rhinos from one grazing and browsing area to another, enhancing their enrichment opportunities.</p>
    <br> <br>
    <h2>
        GREAT ESCAPE
    </h2>
    <p>Venture into the world of the great apes at Great EscApe, a world-class exhibit that allows adventurers to journey through a rainforest and view gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees.
        <br> <br>
        This $6.6 million dollar exhibit occupies a 6-acre plot featuring 3.5 acres of naturalistic habitats for the primates and visitors to enjoy. The exhibit features 18 animals, including: two troops of gorillas with a new infant, one pair of orangutans, and a dynamic community of chimpanzees including three youngsters.
        <br> <br>
        Great EscApe contains many features that make it a premier primate facility in the world. A combination of waterfalls, rocks, fallen trees, pools, and thousands of lush plantings immerse the visitor in a tropical forest.

    <h2>SANCTUARY ASIA
        <br>OKLAHOMA CITY ZOO BREAKS GROUND ON SANCTUARY ASIA </h2>
    <p> As part of the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden's strategic plan outlined in 2010, the new 6.6 acre, $22 million expansion called Sanctuary Asia will create an expansive environment where endangered animals from the Asian continent can thrive while receiving world-class zoological animal care and where a lush, stimulating natural environment can be admired by new audiences in new ways.
        <br> <br>
        Sanctuary Asia is truly a refuge where Asian elephants, and other Asian animals, are protected from predators and habitat loss. Animals within Sanctuary Asia, like all those within the Oklahoma City Zoo, are safe and free to live, socialize, eat, play and explore. The animals are expertly cared for and revered by more than one million annual guests many who will be seeing these animals for the first time and may never visit Asia. Visitors to Sanctuary Asia will be inspired by these magnificent animals, informed about their urgent plight in the wild and be moved to take immediate action to protect them.
        <br> <br>
        Animals: Asian Elephants (adding 3.5 acres to their existing 4.5-acre habitat), red pandas, Asian rhino, langurs, Komodo dragons, raccoon dogs, cranes and cassowary birds.
        <br> <br>
        Restaurant: A two-story building with vast windows will seamlessly unite animal habitats with guest services to create highly visual and memorable experiences. In addition to providing daily food service, the facility is designed for after-hours special events. The restaurant offers views into the elephant, rhino and Komodo dragon habitats.
        <br> <br>
        Water Zone: A splash area for kids to play in the summer
        <br><br>
        Landscape: The landscape design will include plantings native to Oklahoma, but will resemble Asian themes.
