              <!-- (ORIGINAL TEXT) The elephant family in our care is special to us and the world. The family plays an essential role in the survival of the elephant species in Africa and Asia because number of Asian elephants in the wild has diminished to an estimated 30,000 worldwide. Asian elephants can live up to 60 years in the wild, but most do not live that long due to dangers in their environment such as poaching and habitat destruction. The Asian elephant is on the Endangered Species List and is in real threat of becoming extinct if conservation efforts are not made to preserve the species.
                        Asian elephants can grow up to 11,000 pounds and stand about 10 feet tall, although females elephants generally grow to about 8 ½ feet tall and weigh less than their male counterparts. While their size may be distinguishing, their notorious grey color is not—this skin coloration allows them to blend in to their forest environment. Their trunks provide an important adaptation as they allow the elephants to reach objects close to the ground, eat, drink, blow dirt for skin protection, greet other elephants, fight and much more. -->

                <p>There is a new king in town! African lion, Hubert, joined the Zoo in late 2012. He was born at the Milwaukee County Zoo in July 2011 and came to the Zoo as part of the Species Survival Plan supported by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
                   
                    Since then, Hubert has been acclimating to his new habitat and slowly meeting female lions, Tia and Bridget. Tia and Bridget have not had a male lion companion since the death of Zoo-favorite, Aslan, in March 2012.
                   
                    Like Aslan before, Hubert joined the pride as a healthy, young and handsome cat. He will not have a full mane for awhile but will be an impressive, big cat when he is full grown.
                  
                    Although he was initially shy, Hubert is getting more comfortable with his surroundings and has already been seen perched on top of the hill in Lion Overlook surveying his new “kingdom.” Because introductions can take awhile, guests may see either the females or Hubert. As they spend more time bonding, guests may see the entire pride relaxing and playing together.
